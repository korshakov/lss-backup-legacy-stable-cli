	calls source type checks.

	if user specified domain or not. It will mount all required SMB/NFS paths if mount fails it will send
	failed ping.

11 - Local Source Folder Checks
	Script checks if local source folder is empty and if folder exists. If empty or does not exist
	script will send failed ping.

12 - SMB/NFS Source Folder Checks
	Script checks if SMB/NFS source folder is empty and if folder exists. If empty or does not exist
	script will send failed ping.

13 - Destination Type Checks
	Script checks if destination has been specified as LOCAL, SMB, NFS or S3. For SMB and NFS it will further check
	if user specified domain or not. It will mount all required SMB/NFS paths if mount fails it will send
	failed ping.

	creation fails it will send fail ping.

	creation fails it will send fail ping.

16 - S3 Destination checks

	If RSYNC is used as a backup program it will move to lss backup script. If RESTIC is used as a backup it
	will export all restic s3 variables then check if snapshot exist. If not it will ask user to confirm
	that this is first time backup. User has 50 seconds to confirm. If it isn't first run program will exit and
	send failed ping.

18 - LSS Backup
	Script will either run RESTIC or RSYNC to start backup process. It will check all exit codes and based on 
	exit code it will either signal failure or success. User will be able to check exactly what failed
	by following exit code documents. Rsync process at the end moves to backup log cleanup.

19 - LSS No Reten, LSS Reten Keep Last Only , LSS Reten Full
	At the end of restic process if successful it will move to backup retention cleanup. Based on user 
	specified retention script will all backups no longer needed.

	forgotten snapshots.
